I have realized this dashboard through Power BI for monitoring the employers business trips of LA company based.

I wanted to highlight through this project that we can learn different information from Power BI dashboards; we can improve company decision making on people and budget management. For example we can get the following:

1 - The percentage of young people traveling is always below the 25,9% each year. The CEO of the company can think if it can be useful to increase the number of business trips done by young people in order to allow them to develop more experience.

2 - In 2018 and 2021 the departures from Los Angeles were low compared to other years (around 50%-75%). Since the headquarter is based in LA, we definetely expect more departures from LA. A gap of departures in that years could lead us to check internal management problems.

3 - The total number of company employers that deal with working trips each year is between 157 and 182. This numbers can give information about the necessity of hiring new people for doing operations related with travelling. On the other hand, if the boss think this number is too high, he can think to relocate some of these people and make them working on local operations that don't require a business trip.  

4 - The number we have highlighted at step 3, can be useful for making some budget considerations aswell. If we multiply the average cost of a business trip for the toal number of business trips, we get an estimator of the budget dedicated to this operations. This can be useful for decision making regarding budget management.

Mockaroo was the website I have used to generate the dataset.
