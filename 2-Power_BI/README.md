I have realized this dashboard through Power BI for monitoring the business trips of employers of a company.

I wanted to highlight how many specific and detailed information we can get through data visualization tool once we have collected data. For example we can get the following:

1 - The percentage of young people travelling is always below the 25,9% each year. The CEO of the company can think if it can be useful to increase the number of business trips done by young people in order to allow them to develope more experience.

2 - 

Mockaroo was the website I have used to generate the dataset.
