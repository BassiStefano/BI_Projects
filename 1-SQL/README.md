This is a project that is useful for helping a used car company seller to understand which are the main features to keep and to erase for improving sales and decreasing customers claims

I developed this project using SQL and I have splitted my work in two parts:< br / >
    1- Data cleaning - in this phase I have removed rows ambiguity and I have prepared data for the analysis.< br / >
    2- Data analysis - at this moment I could write SQL queries for getting the business information I need for 
                       improving the business decisions making.

I have just published my queries since data could be covered by copyright.
