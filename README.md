I've realized these 3 projects using some of the main technologies for data analysis and business intelligence:

Project 1 – SQL: ‘’The best features of my selling cars’’ 

Project 2 – Power BI: ‘’Optimization of business trips’’ 

Project 3 – Python: ‘’Why linear regression works?’’ 

Enjoy them, if you have any suggestions or constructive feedback, I will happy to hear them!
